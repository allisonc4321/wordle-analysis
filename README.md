# Wordle Analysis Project

For my final project for Math 42 (Introduction to Data-Driven Mathematical Modeling), my group members and I addressed Problem C: Predicting Wordle Results given by the 2023 The Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM)Â®. I cleaned & conducted exploratory data analysis on the provided Wordle dataset to uncover patterns between word attributes and word difficulty. I then visualized relationships between variables using Seaborn and Matplotlib. I also evaluated the significance of observed relationships with NumPy and Statsmodels. My analysis was then used to create a model that predicts the difficulty level of a given Wordle word.
